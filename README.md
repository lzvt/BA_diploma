The thesis is about the effect of the region's economic structure on the turnover of the governor. 

In simple words, if a particular region is characterized by high economic concentration, that is, several large companies operate there, does this mean that it becomes difficult for the governor to manage it, and therefore, such a governor will leave his office earlier than the same one, but in a region with a dominant company or lack thereof.

(It turned out that there really is a difference for governors between regions with a dominant company and regions with no large companies at all.) This may probably be interpreted as the influence of regional elites. 

Data on economic structure were taken from SPARK.
